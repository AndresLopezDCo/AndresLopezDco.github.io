## Work Experience
** Data Analyst - Junior Integrity Engineer (_Jan 2020 - Dec 2021)
- Designed and built data dashboards using Power Bi and DAX transforming and visualizing the prioritization of anomalies and the mechanical state of systems. Included indicators, statistical analysis of corrosion rates, projections of metal loss over time, hydraulic profiles, and safe operating pressures for corrosion-like features. Reducing the budget allocated by 5%.
- Applied advanced Regression and Classification Machine learning methods to systems, predicting corrosion rates with a 10% improvement in accuracy.
- Utilized SQL, Power Query, Python, and advanced Excel-VBA algorithms to extract, prepare, integrate, explore, model, and visualize data from various sources. Provided actionable insights in periodic reports and automated tools.
- Utilized packages for data standardization, variance scaling, normalization, and mean removal, transforming raw data into suitable formats, and enabling efficient modelling and analysis.
- Developed assessment tools using Python, SQL and VBA-Excel for metal loss, dents, cracks, and bending strain. Prioritizing anomalies based on severity, interaction, and geographical location.


** Integrity Engineer
- Designed and built a risk assessment tool by API 581 standards for pipelines, storage tanks, and pressure vessels in oil and gas plants.
- Oversaw the development of a fully responsive application to record, assess and manage mechanical assets in order to optimize operations, prolong lifecycles, and prevent incidents. The technologies used were ReactJS and MongoDB.
