								<h2 class="strong">Mental Health Project - BC</h2>
								<p>
									The <strong>Scope</strong> of this project focused on optimizing mental health resource allocation by conducting a comprehensive 
									assessment of existing facilities. Our objectives included identifying high-demand areas, optimizing bed allocation 
									strategies, fostering collaboration with stakeholders, and utilizing data-driven approaches for evidence-based 
									decision-making. This initiative aimed to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of mental health services, 
									contributing to improved patient outcomes and overall community well-being.

									<h3>Data Sources</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The foundation of this project lies in data extracted from a healthcare database, structured across two 
									primary tables. These tables contained essential information regarding the capacity, occupancy rates, and geographic 
									distribution of mental health facilities. To provide a visual representation of the complex relationships within 
									the dataset, a comprehensive data model was established, depicted in the accompanying picture. The data model showcases 
									four tables, illustrating the adjustments made during the project and capturing the initial state of the data. As a 
									critical step, the calculation of the bed-to-population ratio was undertaken. This metric proved indispensable in 
									identifying areas with higher demand, where occupancy levels had reached critical thresholds. The data model, 
									coupled with calculated ratios, played a pivotal role in formulating targeted strategies for the optimal allocation 
									of mental health resources.

									<h3>Methodology and Analysis</h3>
								</header>
								<p>For this project, I turned to the versatile R programming language to perform the data transformations. 
									The initial data preprocessing involved variable splitting and establishing relationships to facilitate meaningful 
									comparisons. Similarly, a meticulous analysis of unknown values was conducted separately, particularly focusing on
									 beds without corresponding population data.</p>

								<p>Summarized tables were created to support detailed analysis, accompanied by additional calculations to determine
									 populations in intermediate tables. The R script, central to these transformations, played a key role in enhancing 
									 the dataset's utility</p>
						
								<p>For comprehensive analysis, I crafted a variety of charts to pinpoint areas calling out for attention in mental health
									 facility access. The first page focused on a general analysis of areas and regions, exploring the relationship between 
									 beds and population. Horizontal bar charts facilitated comparisons, considering both null and non-null values. Pie charts 
									 visually represented facility distribution in each area.</p>

								<p>I didn't stop there! Introducing tables strategically placed like helpful guides, ready to assist in filtering data based on
									 specific values and locations. User-friendly cards were our way of displaying the status of chosen criteria, ensuring you 
									 have all the information at your fingertips. Turning the page revealed a closer look at beds by facility, accompanied by a 
									 charming bubble map. The bubbles, like friends at a gathering, varied in size, showing the number of beds and helping us 
									 visualize areas with more facilities and beds.</p>
						
								<p>As we continue through pages three and four, we can explored additional variables of interest.This includes, facility types, 
									priority populations, client types, occupancy details, and the age distribution clients. These insights can guided us in 
									crafting strategies to optimize the allocation of mental health resources.</p>

								<p>
									Here you can explore the geographical distribution of health facilities through our interactive map, where the bubble sizes dynamically 
									represent the number of beds available. In addition to incorporating an interactive map, filters and charts, offering 
									 understanding of facility density in specific areas. Allowing easy navigation through regions to understand the spatial distribution 
									 of healthcare resources.

								<p>
									The pie chart showcase of facility types, while the donut chart highlights priority populations served by these facilities. 
									These charts not only provide a visually engaging experience but also simplify the analysis by visualizing fewer categories 
									and discovering distribution patterns in the diversity of facility types and priority populations with just a glance.

								<p>
									The fourth page of our Dashboard opens a window into the demographics and occupancy rates of healthcare facilities, offering a deep 
									understanding of each healthcare areas. For categorical variables with many categories, dynamic Bar charts and Tree maps were used, providing comprehensive insights.
									 Meanwhile, for areas with fewer categories, Pie charts take the spotlight, offering a concise yet insightful overview of demographics.

									<h3> Key Recommendations:</h3>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li> <strong> Mental Health and Substance Abuse Access:</strong>  Based on our analysis, it's advisable to 
										prioritize access to mental health and substance abuse facilities in areas with limited resources, particularly 
										where occupancy has reached 100% or is over capacity.</li>
									
									<li><strong>Invest in Acute Care Facilities:</strong> Increase investment in acute care facilities to improve bed 
										availability for patients requiring intensive medical care. For instance, our analysis revealed that 32 acute 
										facilities have a 100% occupancy rate.</li>
									
									<li><strong>Address Bed Availability Disparities:</strong>Increase the number of beds in the Fraser authority area 
										to rectify the lower availability of beds per 100,000 population compared to other areas.</li>
									
									<li><strong>Improve Resource Distribution:</strong> Develop a plan to allocate beds in unknown Local Health 
										Authorities (LHA) to specific LHAs to enhance the overall distribution of resources.</li>
									
									<li><strong>Implement Effective Monitoring:</strong> Maintain data on occupancy rates for all facilities to 
										continually monitor and manage bed availability effectively.</li>
